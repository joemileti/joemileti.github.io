Course Objectives
</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
<ul>

<li>Understand the motivation behind, and applications of, functions of several variables.</li>

<li>Generalize and extend the computational procedures from Calculus I to the multivariable setting.</li>

<li>Understand the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of our computational techniques, and learn how to explain them using words, pictures, and symbols.</li>

<li>Develop geometric visualization and spatial reasoning skills, especially about objects in three dimensions.</li>

<li>Begin to appreciate the power of abstraction to unify different ideas and applications into one fundamental concept.</li>

</ul>
</p>

</div>



<div class="header">
Problem Sets
</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
Problem Sets will be due for most class periods, and will be posted to the course webpage and to Gradescope. 
<ul>
<li>Each assignment is due at 4:00pm on the corresponding class day.

<li>You must submit a scanned pdf (not photos!) of your solutions to Problem Sets to Gradescope.

<li>Problem sets will be assessed for both overall completion and for correctness of a few chosen problems.

<li>Unless you have a serious emergency that you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted for credit.
  
<li>Your lowest three Problem Set scores will be dropped.
</ul>
</p>

</div>



<div class="header">
Quizzes
</div>

<div class="text">

On Wednesdays without an exam, there will be a short quiz focusing on the material related to the homework problems form the past week.  These quizzes are low stakes (each counts for about 2% of the grade), and are designed to provide regular diagnostic assessments (for both of us!) to help determine where to focus our time. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

</div>



<div class="header">
Exams
</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
There will be three in-class exams and a scheduled three-hour final exam.
</p>

<p>
In-class exams dates:  September 20, October 11, and November 15.
</p>

<p>
Final exam date:  Tuesday, December 12 at 9:00.
</p>

</div>



<div class="header">
Engagement
</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
In addition to problem sets, I expect each of you to engage in the learning process other ways.  You should regularly attend class, contribute to class discussions, and ask questions in office hours or via email.

Math Lab
</div>

<div class="text">
  
<p>
The <a href="https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/MathLab">Math Lab</a>, located in Noyce 2012, is staffed by the director Ren&eacute;e Bourgeois Parsons and many undergraduate student tutors, all of whom are friendly and know Calculus.  It is a great place to work with classmates and/or receive help on assignments.  It is open on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 9am-12pm, 1pm-5pm, and 7pm-10pm, and also on Sundays from 1pm-5pm and 7pm-10pm.

<div class="header">
Academic Honesty
</div>


<div class="text">

<p>
Consult the general <a href="https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=32&navoid=5208#Honesty_in_Academic_Work">Grinnell College policy</a> on Academic Honesty and the associated <a href="https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/DeansOffice/AcademicProgramsLibrary/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FDeansOffice%2FAcademicProgramsLibrary%2FAcademic%5FHonesty%5FBooklet%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FDeansOffice%2FAcademicProgramsLibrary">booklet</a> for general information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <i>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</i>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failure to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <i>your homework must be written up independently in your own words</i>.  You cannot write a communal solution and all copy it down.  You cannot read a solution (from another person, a website, etc.) and alter it slightly in notation/exposition.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances should you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to look at other books or online sources for additional help in understanding concepts and ideas, but <i>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</i>.  However, you may <i>not</i> do any of the following:
<ul>
<li> Specifically search or look for solutions to homework problems in books or online sources.</li>
<li> Solicit help for homework problems from online forums.</li>
<li> Prompt an LLM (or other AI-assisted tool) or computer algebra system (such as Mathematica) to help you with the computation for a specific assigned problem.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Quizzes, Exams, and Final:</b>  You may neither give nor receive help.  Books, written notes, computers, phones, and calculators are not permitted at any time during a testing period.
</p>

<div class="header">
Disabilities
</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
I encourage students with documented disabilities to discuss reasonable accommodations with me so that they can fully participate in the course.  Students will also need to have a conversation with, and provide documentation of your disability to, the Coordinator for Disability Resources, Jae Baldree, located on the first floor of Steiner Hall (x3089).
</p>

</div>


<div class="header">
Religious Observations
</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
I encourage students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with me as soon as possible so that we may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance and also the requirements for this course.
