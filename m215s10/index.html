<i>Linear Algebra and its Applications</i> (Third Updated edition) by David Lay.
</p>

<p>
The book has a <a href="http://wps.aw.com/aw_lay_linearalg_updated_3/36/9433/2414937.cw/index.html">website</a> with some supplementary material and instructions about using calculators/computer packages.

<p>
Problem Sets will be due for most class periods and will be posted to the course webpage.  They must be turned in at the beginning of class.  Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  Your lowest three Problem Set scores will be dropped.

<p>
Unless you have a serious emergency which you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted.  However, please feel free to take advantage of the fact that several assignments scores are dropped to skip writing up a homework assignment if you have more pressing demands on your time.

<ul>
<li> Read the book.  Do not simply read the examples and the big formulas in pretty boxes.  You will need to understand the ideas and theory behind the techniques we develop, and solving problems through mimicry and pattern-recognition will only get you so far.
<li> Although we will start out with very computational topics and homework, the course will become more theoretical as we progress through the semester.  The more abstract topics are challenging and take a great deal of self-study to master.  Set aside study time to simply think about concepts in addition to the time you give yourself to do homework.
<li> The computational techniques we develop in Chapter 1 will be used throughout the course.  Although interesting at first, they quickly become rather tedious.  You must know how to do them by hand, but once we move into later chapter it can save you time and sanity if you let a calculator/computer do the grunt work.  If you do not own a calculator which can do these operations, I recommend learning how to use a software package like Mathematica, Maple, or Matlab.  We will likely take a couple of trips to a computer lab to introduce you to one of these packages.

<p>
Homework:  You must cite other books or online sources if you use them to help solve a problem.  If you enjoy working in groups, I encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems, but you must write on your homework the names of those with whom you worked.  In all cases, <b>your homework is to be written up independently in your own words</b>.  This means you can not write a communal solution and all copy it down, and you can not copy and paste a solution from somewhere else.  In general, getting ideas from other people or sources is fine (so long as you do not read another solution), but you need to cite this assistance and then take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.
</p>

<p>
Exams:  You may neither give nor receive help.  Written notes and computers are not permitted, although on some exams you may be allowed a (non-graphing) scientific calculator.

Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course that may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an office appointment with me in first few weeks of class.  You will need to provide documentation of your disability to the Associate Dean and Director of Academic Advising, Joyce Stern, located in the lower level of the Forum (x3702).
