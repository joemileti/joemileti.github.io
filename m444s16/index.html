<p>
There is no required textbook.  I will be posting course notes here: <a href="mathlogic.pdf">Current Notes</a><br>
Please let me know if you find typos or if you have suggestions!
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to consult other sources as supplements.  The following books cover most of the material on first-order logic:
<ul>
<li> <i>Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic</i> by Peter Hinman.<br>
<li> <i>A Mathematical Introduction to Logic</i> by Herbert Enderton.<br>
<li> <i>Mathematical Logic</i> by Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus, Jorg Flum, and Wolfgang Thomas.<br>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For the set theory material, I recommend the following:
<ul>
<li> <i>Discovering Modern Set Theory, I:  The Basics</i> by Winfried Just and Martin Weese.<br>
<li> <i>Set Theory</i> by Kenneth Kunen.<br>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Develop technical writing skills, including the ability to communicate abstract mathematical ideas clearly and elegantly.
<li>Master new types of inductive arguments and recursive constructions.
<li>Understand the dual role of logical systems:  as interesting mathematical objects of their own, and as powerful tools to prove theorems in other areas of mathematics.
<li>Develop a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, the connections between syntactic symbols and semantic meaning.
<li>Learn about the interdisciplinary nature of logic by understanding fundamental connections to computer science and philosophy.
<li>Continue to hone your perseverance in problem solving.
</ul>

<p>
Homework assignments will be due on Fridays, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Each assignment is due at 5:00pm on the given Friday.
<li>All homework must be typeset and submitted electronically by email.
<li>Your lowest homework score will be dropped.
<li>Solutions to the homework will be posted to the course webpage.
<li>Unless you have a serious emergency that you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted for credit.
<li>Some homework assignments will include challenge problems.  These problems are either particularly difficult, or involve techniques that are not typically covered in prerequisite courses.  They will not be graded for credit, but exist for extra fun and enrichment.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Homework will be graded on the basis of correctness, elegance, and also clarity of exposition.  You have all had experience writing mathematical proofs, and one important goal of this goal is to hone your mathematical writing skills.  You should take extra time to organize and write your solutions after you have solved the problems.  Write in complete sentences and connect mathematical symbolism with explanation.  A correct solution which is difficult to read and understand will not receive full credit.  Think of each assignment as a small paper that you are writing for a Social Studies or Humanities course.
</p>

<p>
I strongly recommend using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to write up your homework assignments.  Take the time to learn the basics (and install it on your machine) during the first week of class.  I can provide you with some assistance and sample documents.

<p>
Consult the general <a href="http://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty_in_Academic_Work">Grinnell College policy</a> on Academic Honesty and the associated <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/AcadHonesty%202015-16_0.pdf">booklet</a> for general information.
</p>

<p>
<i>Homework:</i> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <b>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</b>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <b>your homework must be written up independently</b>.  You can not write a communal solution and all copy it down.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances can you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to look to other books or online sources for additional help in understanding concepts and ideas, but <b>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</b>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.
</p>

<p>
<i>Exam and Final:</i>  You may neither give nor receive help from others.  You will be allowed to consult the material from the course (the official notes and homework solutions, as well as your own notes and homework).

Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course with disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an office appointment with me in first few weeks of class.  You will need to provide documentation of your disability to the Coordinator of Disability Resources, Autumn Wilke, located on the third floor of the JRC (x3702).
