We will mostly follow <i>Invitation to Ergodic Theory</i> by C. E. Silva.  See the <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/csilva/InvErgodicTh_Errata_10_23_08.pdf">errata</a> for corrections.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to consult other sources as supplements.  The following books cover most of the measure theory material:
<ul>
<li> <i>Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space</i> by Frank Jones.<br>
<li> <i>A Radical Approach to Lebesgue's Theory of Integration</i> by David M. Bressoud.<br>
<li> <i>Real Analysis</i> by H. L. Royden.<br>
</ul>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Develop technical writing skills, including the ability to communicate abstract mathematical ideas clearly and elegantly.
<li>Master fundamental analytic ideas: open sets, compactness, infinite sums, approximation, completeness, continuity, integration, measure.
<li>Develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the real line.
<li>Appreciate some of the historical background that naturally led to several modern analytic concepts. 
<li>Continue to hone your perseverance in problem solving.
</ul>

<p>
Homework assignments will be due on Fridays, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Each assignment is due at 5:00pm on the given Friday.
<li>All homework must be typeset and submitted electronically by email.
<li>Your lowest homework score will be dropped.
<li>Solutions to the homework will be posted to the course webpage.
<li>Throughout the semester, you may extend the deadline of any homework assignment by up to 4 total days.  For example, you can choose to turn in one assignment 1 day late, and another assignment 3 days late.  Note that any late work is rounded up to the nearest day (so turning in an assignment 1 hour late rounds up to 1 day).  Beyond this, late homework will not be accepted for credit.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Homework will be graded on the basis of correctness, elegance, and also clarity of exposition.  You have all had experience writing mathematical proofs, and one important goal of this goal is to hone your mathematical writing skills.  You should take extra time to organize and write your solutions after you have solved the problems.  Write in complete sentences and connect mathematical symbolism with explanation.  A correct solution which is difficult to read and understand will not receive full credit.  Think of each assignment as a small paper that you are writing for a Social Studies or Humanities course.

<p>
Consult the general <a href="http://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty_in_Academic_Work">Grinnell College policy</a> on Academic Honesty and the associated <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/AcadHonesty%202016-17.pdf">booklet</a> for general information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <i>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</i>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <i>your homework must be written up independently in your own words</i>.  You can not write a communal solution and all copy it down.  You can not read one person's solution and alter it slightly in notation/exposition.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances can you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to look to other books or online sources for additional help in understanding concepts and ideas, but <i>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</i>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.
</p>




<p>
<b>Exam and Final:</b>  You may neither give nor receive help from others.  You will be allowed to consult the material from the course (the official book and homework solutions, as well as your own notes and homework).

<p>
Grinnell College makes reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students need to provide documentation to the Coordinator for Disability Resources, Autumn Wilke, located on the 3rd floor of the Rosenfield Center (x3702). Students should then speak with me as early as possible in the semester we can discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course and coordinate your accommodations.

<p>
I encourage students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with me as soon as possible so that we may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance and also the requirements for this course.
