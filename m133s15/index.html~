<p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the motivation for, and applications of, functions of several variables.
<li>Generalize and extend the computational procedures from Calculus I to the multivariable setting.
<li>Understand the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of our computational techniques, and learn how to explain them using both words and symbols.
<li>Develop geomertic visualization and reasoning skills.
<li>Begin to appreciate the power of abstraction to unify different ideas and applications into one fundamental concept.
</ul>

<p>
Problem Sets will be due on most Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  All homework assignments consisting of more than one page must be stapled.
<li>Homework is due at the beginning of class (i.e. at 9:00am for Section 1 and at 2:15pm for Section 3).  Homework turned in after this point is considered late.
<li>Unless you have a serious emergency that you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted for credit.
<li>Your lowest four Problem Set scores will be dropped.
</ul>

<ul>

<p>
<li> Read the book.  Do not simply read the examples and the big formulas in pretty boxes.  You will need to understand some of the ideas and theory behind the techniques we develop, and solving problems through mimicry and pattern-recognition will only get you so far.
</p>

<p>
<li> Stay on top of the the material.  Moreso than many other subjects, mathematics builds on itself quickly.  You will have great difficulty understanding next week's material if you are not very comfortable with this week's material.  If you are struggling with a topic, avoid the natural urge to put it off until later and seek help immediately.
</p>

<p>
<li> Be alert in class and ask questions!  Stay well-rested to allow yourself the ability to focus on the material in each class so you avoid falling behind (see above).  If you have a question about anything we are doing, speak up!  Also, don't be afraid to say something general like "I didn't understand that, can you explain it again?".
</p>

<p>
<li>I really enjoy interacting with students. Please come to my office hours when you want assistance!  To use our time together most effectively, it helps if you have grappled with the ideas and you bring some of your scratch work and attempts.  One of the most difficult parts of your mathematical education is learning how to transition from having no idea, to obtaining vague hunches, to seizing on key ideas, to writing complete and accurate solutions.  If you bring your ideas and scratch work, we can focus on how to help you manage these transitions.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/arc/math-lab">Math Lab</a>, located in Science Center 2012, is a great place to work with classmates and/or receive help on assignments.

<p>
<i>Homework:</i> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <b>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</b>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You should also credit the Math Lab for help that they provide.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <b>your homework must be written up independently</b>.  You can not write a communal solution and all copy it down.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances can you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
You may look at sources other than our textbook, but <b>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</b>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.  
</p>

<p>
<i>Exams and final:</i>  You may neither give nor receive help.  Books, written notes and computers are not permitted.  You will be allowed to use a (non-graphing) scientific calculator.

Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course that may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an office appointment with me in first few weeks of class.  You will need to provide documentation of your disability to Joyce Stern, teh Dean for Student Success and Academic Advising, who is located on the third floor of the JRC.

I encourage students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with me as soon as possible so that we may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance and also the requirements for this course.
