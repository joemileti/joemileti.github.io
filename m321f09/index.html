<p>
Homework assignments will be due for most class periods and will be posted to the course webpage.  They must be turned in at the beginning of class.  Solutions to the homework will also be posted online (likely on PioneerWeb).  Please take the time to write up your solutions neatly and carefully!  Your lowest three homework scores will be dropped.
</p>

<p>
Although there will certainly be some "computational" problems in the course, most of the homework involves writing proofs.  This often means that there there are many correct answers.  This also means that the clarity of exposition and the proper use of mathematical terminology are as vital to your solutions as having the correct idea.  I understand that you may not be entirely comfortable with writing mathematical proofs (especially early in the course), but learning the standards of such proofs is as important a goal of this course as is learning the technical material.  Do not be alarmed if your homework has many comments about how to tighten your mathematical prose.

<p>
Unless you have a serious emergency which you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted.  However, please feel free to take advantage of the fact that several homework scores are dropped to skip writing up a homework assignment if you have more pressing demands on your time.

  </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Read the book.  A lot.  I read one chapter of my algebra book nine
times during the course of the semester (not counting reading portions of
it to help with homework problems).  This is normal, as you should not
expect to master a section from going to class and reading it once.
<li> When reading the book, do not sit down and read through it like you would a novel.  After reading a proof, stop to process it in your own way and then work through it again in your own words.  When you see an example illustrating a result, go back through the proof in the context of that one example.
<li> There are a nontrivial number of definitions in this course that you will be expected to know.  In my experience, memorizing them is not helpful, and the way to know a definition is to work with it (both on the homework and on your own) until you are so comfortable that it becomes natural.
<li> <b>The material is challenging at both a high abstract level and a detail-oriented technical level.</b>  In my opinion, the best way to understand both is to switch back and forth between the two often.  When trying to understand a difficult theorem, think about what it says in terms of examples you know in addition to reading the proof many times.  When working through an example, picture it in the context high level theory we are developing.
</ul>

<p>
Homework:  You must cite other books or online sources if you use them to help solve a problem.  If you enjoy working in groups, I encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems, but please write on your homework who you worked with.  In all cases, <b>your homework is to be written up independently in your own words</b>.  This means you can not write a communal solution and all copy it down, and you can not copy and paste a solution from somewhere else.  In general, getting ideas from other people or sources is fine (so long as you do not read another solution), but take those ideas and go write the problem up on your own.
</p>

<p>
Exams:  You may neither give nor receive help.  Written notes and computers are not permitted.

Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course that may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an office appointment with me in first few weeks of class.  You will need to provide documentation of your disability to the Associate Dean and Director of Academic Advising, Joyce Stern, located in the lower level of the Forum (x3702).
