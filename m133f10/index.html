Problem Sets will be due on most Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  They will be posted to the course webpage and <b>must be turned in at the beginning of class</b>.  Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  Your lowest three Problem Set scores will be dropped.

<p>
Unless you have a serious emergency which you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted.  However, please feel free to take advantage of the fact that several assignments scores are dropped to skip writing up a homework assignment if you have more pressing demands on your time.

<ul>
<li> Read the book.  Do not simply read the examples and the big formulas in pretty boxes.  You will need to understand some of the ideas and theory behind the techniques we develop, and solving problems through mimicry and pattern-recognition will only get you so far.
<li> Stay on top of the the material.  Moreso than many other subjects, mathematics builds on itself quickly.  You will have great difficulty understanding next week's material if you are not very comfortable with this week's material.  If you are struggling with a topic, avoid the natural urge to put it off until later and seek help immediately.
<li> Be alert in class and ask questions!  Stay well-rested to allow yourself the ability to focus on the material in each class so you avoid falling behind (see above).  If you have pointed questions about anything we are doing, speak up!  Also, don't be afraid to say something more general like "I didn't understand that, can you explain it again?".
</ul>

<p>
Homework:  You must cite other books or online sources if you use them to help solve a problem.  If you enjoy working in groups, I encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems, but you must write on your homework the names of those with whom you worked.  In all cases, <b>your homework is to be written up independently in your own words</b>.  This means you can not write a communal solution and all copy it down, and you can not copy and paste a solution from somewhere else.  In general, getting ideas from other people or sources is fine (so long as you do not read another solution), but <b>you need to cite such assistance</b> and then take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.
</p>

<p>
Exams:  You may neither give nor receive help.  Written notes and computers are not permitted, although on some exams you may be allowed a (non-graphing) scientific calculator.
