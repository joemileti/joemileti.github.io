<p>
<ul>
<li> Master several different ways to describe and represent functions, such as through formulas, graphs, tables, and explanations.
<li> Develop your ability to model relationships between numerical values using functions.
<li> Develop computational techniques and visualization skills to aid in understanding the behavior of a function.
<li> Learn the tools of differential calculus, which provide powerful ways to determine how fast a function is changing.
<li> Understand the conceptual underpinnings of our computational techniques, and learn how to explain them using both words and symbols.
<li> Develop logical reasoning skills and comfort with common mathematical notation.
</ul>

<p>
Problem Sets will be due on most class days, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Problem sets are due at the beginning of class (i.e. at 10:00am).  Homework turned in after this point is considered late.
<li>Your lowest four Problem Set scores will be dropped.
<li>Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  All homework assignments consisting of more than one page must be stapled.
<li>Unless you have a serious emergency that you bring to my attention
  before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted
  for credit.  However, please feel free to take advantage of the fact that
  four homework scores are dropped to skip writing up a homework assignment if you have more pressing demands on your time.
</ul>

<p>
There will be two in class exams and a scheduled three hour final exam.
</p>

<p>
In class exams dates:  October 2 and November 20.<br>
Final exam date:  Tuesday, December 15 at 9:00am. 
</p>

<p>
On Fridays without an exam, there will be a short quiz focusing on the material related to the homework problems form the past week.  These quizzes are low stakes (each counts for about 2% of the grade), and are designed to provide regular diagonstic assessments (for both of us!) to help determine where to focus our time.  Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

<ul>

<p>
<li> Read the book.  Do not simply read the examples and the big formulas in pretty boxes.  Work to understand the concepts behind the techniques we develop, and avoid the temptation of solving problems through only mimicry and pattern-recognition.
</p>

<p>
<li> Stay on top of the the material.  Moreso than many other subjects, mathematics builds on itself quickly.  You will have great difficulty understanding next week's material if you are not very comfortable with this week's material.  If you are struggling with a topic, avoid the natural urge to put it off until later and seek help immediately.
</p>

<p>
<li> Be alert in class and ask questions!  Stay well-rested to allow yourself the ability to focus on the material in each class so you avoid falling behind (see above).  If you have pointed questions about anything we are doing, speak up!  Also, don't be afraid to say something more general like "I didn't understand that, can you explain it again?".
</p>

<p>
<li> I really enjoy interacting with students. Please come to my office hours when you want assistance!  To use our time together most effectively, it helps if you have grappled with the ideas and you bring some of your scratch work and attempts.  One of the most difficult parts of your mathematical education is learning how to transition from having no idea, to obtaining vague hunches, to seizing on key ideas, to writing complete and accurate solutions.  If you bring your ideas and scratch work, we can focus on how to help you manage these transitions.

<p>
Consult the general <a href="http://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty_in_Academic_Work">Grinnell College policy</a> on Academic Honesty and the associated <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/AcadHonesty%202015-16.pdf">booklet</a> for general information.
</p>


<p>
<i>Homework:</i> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <b>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</b>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You should also credit the Math Lab for help that they provide.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <b>your homework must be written up independently</b>.  You can not write a communal solution and all copy it down.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances can you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
You may look at sources other than our textbook, but <b>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</b>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.  
</p>

<p>
<i>Quizzes, Exams, and final:</i>  You may neither give nor receive help.  Books, written notes and computers are not permitted.  You will be allowed to use a (non-graphing) scientific calculator.

Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course that may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an office appointment with me in first few weeks of class.  You will need to provide documentation of your disability to the Coordinator of Disability Resources, Autumn Wilke, located on the third floor of the JRC (x3702).
