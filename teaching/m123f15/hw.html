<p>
Problem Sets will be due on most class days, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Problem sets are due at the beginning of class (i.e. at 10:00am).  Homework turned in after this point is considered late.
<li>Your lowest four Problem Set scores will be dropped.
<li>Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  All homework assignments consisting of more than one page must be stapled.
<li>Unless you have a serious emergency that you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted for credit.  However, please feel free to take advantage of the fact that four homework scores are dropped to skip writing up a homework assignment if you have more pressing demands on your time.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <b>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</b>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You should also credit the Math Lab for help that they provide.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <b>your homework must be written up independently</b>.  You can not write a communal solution and all copy it down.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances can you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
You may look at sources other than our textbook, but <b>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</b>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.
