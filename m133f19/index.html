<p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the motivation behind, and applications of, functions of several variables.
<li>Generalize and extend the computational procedures from Calculus I to the multivariable setting.
<li>Understand the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of our computational techniques, and learn how to explain them using words, pictures, and symbols.
<li>Develop geometric visualization and spatial reasoning skills, especially about objects in three dimensions.
<li>Begin to appreciate the power of abstraction to unify different ideas and applications into one fundamental concept.
</ul>

<p>
Problem Sets will be due for most class periods, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Homework is due at the beginning of class (i.e. at 1:00pm).  If you are late for class, but turn an assignment in when you enter, your homework will be subject to a 10% penalty.
<li>Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  All homework assignments consisting of more than one page must be stapled.
<li>Unless you have a serious emergency that you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted for credit.
<li>Your lowest three Problem Set scores will be dropped.
</ul>

<p>
There will be three in class exams and a scheduled three hour final exam.
</p>

<p>
In class exams dates:  September 25, October 16, and November 20.<br>
Final exam date:  Friday, December 20 at 2:00pm.
</p>

<p>
On Wednesdays without an exam, there will be a short quiz focusing on the material related to the homework problems form the past week. These quizzes are low stakes (each counts for about 2% of the grade), and are designed to provide regular diagnostic assessments (for both of us!) to help determine where to focus our time. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

<ul>

<p>
<li> Read the book.  Do not simply read the examples and the big formulas in pretty boxes.  While the example problems in the book are useful, you should also spend time reading the exposition slowly and carefully.  Play around with the conceptual ideas until you start to become comfortable with them.  It is important to understand some of the concepts and theory behind the techniques we develop, and solving problems through mimicry and pattern-recognition will only get you so far.
</p>

<p>
<li> Stay on top of the the material.  Moreso than many other subjects, mathematics builds on itself quickly.  You will have great difficulty understanding next week's material if you are not very comfortable with this week's material.  If you are struggling with a topic, avoid the natural urge to put it off until later and seek help!  Come to office hours, go to the Math Lab, send me an email, talk to friends in class, etc.
</p>

<p>
<li> Be alert in class and ask questions!  Stay well-rested in order to be able to focus on the material in each class so that you do not fall behind (see above).  If you have a question about anything we are doing, speak up.  Also, don't be afraid to say something general like "I didn't understand that, can you explain it again?".
</p>

<p>
<li>I really enjoy interacting with students. Please come to my office hours when you want assistance!  To use our time together most effectively, it helps if you have grappled with the ideas and you bring some of your scratch work and attempts.  One of the most difficult parts of your mathematical education is learning how to transition from having no idea, to obtaining vague hunches, to seizing on key ideas, to writing complete and accurate solutions.  If you bring your ideas and scratch work, we can focus on how to help you manage these transitions.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/math-stats/math-lab">Math Lab</a>, located in Noyce 2012, is a great place to work with classmates and/or receive help on assignments.

<p>
Consult the general <a href="http://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty_in_Academic_Work">Grinnell College policy</a> on Academic Honesty and the associated <a href="https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/AcadProg/Academic_Honesty_Booklet.pdf">booklet</a> for general information.
</p>


<p>
<b>Homework:</b> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <i>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</i>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You should also credit the Math Lab for help that they provide.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <i>your homework must be written up independently in your own words</i>.  You can not write a communal solution and all copy it down.  You can not read one person's solution and alter it slightly in notation/exposition.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances should you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
You may look at sources other than our textbook, but <i>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</i>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.
</p>


<p>
<b>Quizzes, Exams, and Final:</b>  You may neither give nor receive help.  Books, written notes, computers, phones, and calculators are not permitted at any time during a testing period.

I encourage students with documented disabilities to discuss appropriate accommodations with me.
