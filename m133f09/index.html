<p>
Problem Sets will be due for most class periods and will be posted to the course webpage.  They must be turned in at the beginning of class.  Please take the time to write your solutions neatly and carefully!  Your lowest three Problem Set scores will be dropped.

<p>
Written assignments will be due on most Fridays, and also must be turned in at the beginning of class.  Please hand these in separately from Problem Sets!  These problems either are more conceptually based or require explanation above and beyond those of routine exercises.  Your solutions should consist of you carefully explaining your solutions in complete sentences.  They will be graded at a high standard which involves much more that getting the "correct answer".  Your lowest Written Assignment score will be dropped.
</p>

<p>
You may find it unusual to be writing in a math course.  Here are just a few of the reasons why we are doing it.
<ul>
<li> Up until this point, it is possible (even likely) that much of your understanding of mathematics has arisen through mimicry and "following the recipe".  If so, we are now taking the first steps toward a more conceptual understanding of mathematics.  If you want to apply the mathematical tools learned in this course in your later endeavors, it is <i>extremely</i> unlikely that the problem you are facing fits into the mold of a standard textbook exercise (at the end of the section telling you exactly how to do it).  As such, it is important to understand what you are doing beyond the "plug and chug" so that you can find the appropriate tools that will help you.
<li> Believe it or not, this is how mathematicians do their work.  We try to convince ourselves and others of new ideas, and a sequence of mathematical symbols in a new context is as incomprehensible to us as it is to you.  Only through careful exposition, and much reflection on the reader's part, does it begin to make sense.
</ul>
</p>

Here are the two examples of Written Assignments from the first day of class.<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="SampleWA1.pdf">Example 1</a>:  Calculating an integral by interpreting it as an area.
<li> <a href="SampleWA2.pdf">Example 2</a>:  Explaining the method of u-substitution.

<p>
Unless you have a serious emergency which you bring to my attention before a homework assignment is due, late homework will not be accepted.  However, please feel free to take advantage of the fact that several assignments scores are dropped to skip writing up a homework assignment if you have more pressing demands on your time.

<ul>
<li> Read the book.  Do not simply read the examples and the big formulas in pretty boxes.  You will need to understand some of the ideas and theory behind the techniques we develop, and solving problems through mimicry and pattern-recognition will only get you so far.
<li> Stay on top of the the material.  Moreso than many other subjects, mathematics builds on itself quickly.  Thus, you will have great difficulty understanding next week's material if you are not very comfortable with this week's material.  If you are struggling with a topic, avoid the natural urge to put it off until later and seek help immediately.
<li> Be alert in class and ask questions!  Stay well-rested to allow yourself the ability to focus on the material in each class so you avoid falling behind (see above).  If you have pointed questions about anything we are doing, speak up!  Also, don't be afraid to say something more general like "I didn't understand that, can you explain it again?".

<p>
Homework (Problem Sets and Written Assignments):  You must cite other books or online sources if you use them to help solve a problem.  If you enjoy working in groups, I encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems, but please write on your homework who you worked with.  In all cases, <b>your homework is to be written up independently in your own words</b>.  This means you can not write a communal solution and all copy it down, and you can not copy and paste a solution from somewhere else.  In general, getting ideas from other people or sources is fine (so long as you do not read another solution), but you should take those ideas and go write the problem up on your own.
</p>

<p>
Exams:  You may neither give nor receive help.  Written notes and computers are not permitted, although on some exams you may be allowed a (non-graphing) scientific calculator.

Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course that may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an office appointment with me in first few weeks of class.  You will need to provide documentation of your disability to the Associate Dean and Director of Academic Advising, Joyce Stern, located in the lower level of the Forum (x3702).
