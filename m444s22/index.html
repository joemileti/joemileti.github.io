We will be using an early version of my book <i>Modern Mathematical Logic</i>.  Please let me know if you find any typos or errors!
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to consult other sources as supplements.  The following books cover most of the material on first-order logic:
<ul>
<li> <i>A Mathematical Introduction to Logic</i> by Herbert Enderton.<br>
<li> <i>Mathematical Logic</i> by Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus, Jorg Flum, and Wolfgang Thomas.<br>
<li> <i>Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic</i> by Peter Hinman.<br>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For the computability theory material, I recommend the following:
<ul>
<li> <i>Computability: An Introduction to Recursive Function Theory</i> by Nigel Cutland.<br>
<li> <i>Computability Theory</i> by Herbert Enderton.<br>
</ul>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Develop technical writing skills, including the ability to communicate abstract mathematical ideas clearly and elegantly.</li>

<li>Master new types of inductive arguments and recursive constructions.</li>

<li>Understand the dual role of logical systems:  as interesting mathematical objects of their own, and as powerful tools to prove theorems in other areas of mathematics.</li>

<li>Develop a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, the connections between syntactic symbols and semantic meaning.</li>

<li>Learn about the interdisciplinary nature of logic by understanding fundamental connections to computer science and philosophy.</li>

<li>Continue to hone your perseverance in problem solving.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Homework assignments will be due on most Fridays, and will be posted to the course webpage.
<ul>
<li>Homework is due at 5:00pm Grinnell time.</li>

<li>Your solutions should be typeset (preferably using LaTeX) and should be submitted as <i>one pdf file</i> to the corresponding homework folder within your course OneDrive folder (that I will share with you).</li>

<li>Your lowest homework score will be dropped.</li>

<li>Throughout the semester, you may extend the deadline of at most two homework assignments until the following Monday.  If you choose to extend the deadline of an assignment, you should send me an email by the usual due date.  Beyond these two extensions, late homework will not be accepted for credit, unless there is an emergency that you bring to my attention before the due date.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of the goals of the course is to give you an opportunity to work through a topic of your choosing in depth, and present your work to the class.  I will provide several possible suggestions, but you can pursue any topic that has a connection with mathematical logic.

<p>
Consult the general <a href="http://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty_in_Academic_Work">Grinnell College policy</a> on Academic Honesty and the associated <a href="https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/AcadProg/Academic_Honesty_Booklet.pdf">booklet</a> for general information.
</p>

<p>
<i>Homework:</i> If you enjoy working in groups, I strongly encourage you to work with others in the class to solve the homework problems.  If you do collaborative work or receive help form somebody in the course, <i>you must acknowledge this on the corresponding problem(s)</i>.  Writing "I worked with Sam on this problem" or "Mary helped me with this problem" suffices.  You may ask students outside the course for help, but you need to make sure they understand the academic honesty policies for the course and you need to cite their assistance as well.  Failing to acknowledge such collaboration or assistance is a violation of academic honesty.
</p>

<p>
If you work with others, <i>your homework must be written up independently in your own words</i>.  You cannot write a communal solution and all copy it down.  You cannot read one person's solution and alter it slightly in notation/exposition.  Discussing ideas and/or writing parts of computations together on whiteboards or scratch paper is perfectly fine, but you need to take those ideas and write the problem up on your own.  Under no circumstances should you look at another student's completed written work.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to look to other books or online sources for additional help in understanding concepts and ideas, but <b>you must cite other books or online sources if they provide you with an idea that helps you solve a problem</b>.  However, you may not specifically look for solutions to homework problems, and you may not solicit help for homework problems from online forums.

I encourage students with documented disabilities to discuss appropriate accommodations with me.  You will also need to have a conversation with, and provide documentation of your disability to, the Coordinator for Disability Resources, located on the ground level floor of Steiner Hall (641-269-3124).

<p>
I encourage students who plan to observe holy days that coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with me as soon as possible so that we may reach a mutual understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance and also the requirements for this course.
